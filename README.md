# R_examination
**Tasks performed for the R exam at HU Berlin**
(only with base R)

**Exercise 1 Data Analysis**
Take a datafile on mortgages for households, reorganize the data, evaluate it and perform couple of tests to check for various hypothesises.

**Exercise 2 Time series Analysis**
Take a historic datafile on streamflow evaluatins from 1911 to 1960, create a propper time series vector. Compute an exponential trend for the evaluations on time, evaluate the trend. Plot the time series and decompose it.

**Exercise 3 Data visualization**
Read a datafile on mortgages and mimic a given complex set of plots.

**Exercise 4 Data Cleaning and Regex**
Load a datafile of common Bavarian nicknames. Clean the data, getting rid of the empty values, duplicates, create complex regex patterns to reorganize the data to be used for further analysis. 

**Exercise 5 Memory** 
The game Memory is a card game, which can be played by any number of persons (including 1). Pairs
of equal cards (usually 26 different cards, i.e., 52 cards in total) are arranged randomly in a grid face down. In turn, each player chooses two cards and turns them face up, which is considered
one move. If the cards are equal, then that player wins the pair and makes another move. If the symbols
are diffrent, the cards are turned face down again and play passes to the next player. The game ends
when the last pair has been picked up. The player with the most pairs wins. Write a function memory that enables to play Memory via the R console.
